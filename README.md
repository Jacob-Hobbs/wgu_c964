# WGU CS Capstone Project

This repository is used to house my submission for WGU c964 (computer science capstone). This project is small a CNN (convoluted-neural network) image-recognition program used to distinguish between wasps and humans within an apple orchard setting. In conception, the program was to be used by a fictional pesticide robot that, when presented with the visual stimulus of a wasp, would spray pesticide. The recognition features of the program and very accurate and can be tested with the included sample pictures.
